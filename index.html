<h3> The Cuban Missile Crisis</h3>
<p>
The Cuban Missile Crisis was an incredible show of diplomatic intelligence and strategy. Kennedy pooled the resources of the CIA and his secret committee Executive Committee of the National Security Council  (EXCOMM) together to thwart attempt by the Soviets to complete the development of MRBM’s on the island of Cuba. Under the consultation of key members of EXCOMM such as Robert McNamara and General Taylor, Kennedy decided to create a naval blockade that prevented any Soviet ships from crossing into Cuban waters. This was an incredibly genius move because as per his speech on October 22nd, 1962, Kennedy managed to paint the US as standing up for what was right and if violence was to occur it would be the Soviet’s decision to become the aggressor.
